This Machine Learning project focuses on predicting the 'Close' price for a dataset containing 58 Nifty stocks from the beginning of 2024 through early September. The workflow heavily emphasized preprocessing, including cleaning missing data by filling all NaNs with 0, and performing extensive feature engineering to create market signals. Key features developed were the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), the 50-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), and various volatility and MACD-related metrics. After converting stock symbols and categories into numerical form using Label Encoding, three regression models—Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were trained. All three models achieved exceptionally high R2 scores (approximately 1.0), demonstrating virtually perfect prediction of the closing price on the test set, confirming the strong predictive power of the combined price history and technical indicators.
