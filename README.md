This document summarizes the entire workflow and results derived from the provided Jupyter Notebook, covering the data, feature engineering, and the highly successful machine learning models used for stock price prediction.

## Overview of the ML Project on Nifty Stocks

The project is an end-to-end machine learning analysis aimed at **predicting the 'Close' price** for a dataset of **58 Nifty stocks** spanning from January 1, 2024, to September 11, 2024. The analysis follows a rigorous process of data preprocessing, extensive feature engineering using financial technical indicators, and training three distinct regression models.

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

The initial phase focused on preparing the raw financial data:

* **Data Cleaning:** The dataset, comprising 10,818 daily entries, was checked for missing values, with all `NaN` entries (primarily in the `Cumulative_Return` column and those generated by rolling calculations) being **filled with zero** (`0`).
* **Feature Creation (Technical Indicators):** Several powerful technical indicators were engineered to capture stock dynamics:
    * **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):** Both 50-day (`SMA_50`) and 200-day (`SMA_200`) moving averages were calculated to identify longer-term trends.
    * **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** A 50-day RSI was calculated to measure the magnitude of recent price changes, assessing overbought or oversold conditions.
    * **MACD Components:** Features based on 12-day, 26-day, and 9-day rolling means (`MACD12`, `MACD26`, `MACD9`) were created, serving as moving average convergence/divergence inputs.
    * **Volatility:** Measures for rolling volatility, daily volatility, and annual volatility were also computed.
* **Encoding:** The categorical columns, `Symbol` (stock ticker) and `Category` (industry group), were converted into numerical features using **Label Encoding** for model compatibility.

## Machine Learning Model Results

The prepared data was split into training and testing sets (80/20 split), with the 'Close' price serving as the target variable for prediction. Three regression algorithms were tested:

| Model | $R^2$ Score (Accuracy) | Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Regression** | $1.000000$ | Achieved perfect or near-perfect correlation with the actual prices. |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | $0.999994$ | Showed excellent non-linear fitting performance. |
| **XGBoost Regressor** | $0.999994$ | Highly effective, delivering results on par with the Random Forest model. |

All three models demonstrated **extremely high predictive accuracy** (an $R^2$ score close to $1.0$), which is typical in time series prediction tasks like this where the current closing price is heavily dependent on immediately preceding values (Open, High, Low) and technical indicators derived from recent historical prices. The results suggest the features engineered are highly effective in modeling the movement of the stock prices within the dataset.
